This view became very popular during a\ntime called the Enlightenment when thinkers tried to move away\nfrom superstition and blind faith. They wanted to build\nknowledge  on solid ground. This move brought many good\nthings. It helped create modern science, medicine, and\ntechnology. It helped us question harmful traditions and find\nbetter ways to live.\nBut something unexpected happened as rationalism grew\nstronger. People began to feel that life had less meaning. The\nFrench philosopher Blaise Pascal saw this problem hundreds of\nyears ago. He wrote that reason alone makes people feel small\nand lost in an empty universe. He said, \"The heart has reasons that\nreason cannot know.\" He didn't mean we should ignore logic.

Our brains\nwork in mysterious ways. They can solve complex problems in\nthe background while we do other things. They make connections\nbetween ideas when we're not even trying. They process emotions\nand experiences while we sleep. But most of us never tap i nto\nthese powerful abilities because we're too busy, too distracted, or\ntoo focused on pure logic.\nScientists have found that short spiritual practices trigger\nspecial brain states that boost creativity, reduce stress, and help\nus see connections we normally miss. These states activate parts\nof our brain that logical thinking alone never reaches. The be st\npart?",

These aren't just nice feelings - they\nrepresent actual changes in how their brains process information.\nWhy Three Minutes Is All You Need\nThree minutes seems too short to matter. How could such a\nbrief practice make any real difference? The answer lies in how\nour brains form new neural pathways. Our brains change through\nconsistent patterns repeated over time, not through occasional big\nefforts.\nThink about learning to drive a car. At first, you had to think\nabout every small action - turning the key, pressing the pedals,\nchecking mirrors. It felt overwhelming. But after doing these\nactions repeatedly, they became automatic. Your brain formed\nstrong neural pathways for driving. Now you can drive while\nhaving a conversation or thinking about your day.",

Both\nviews are one -sided, neither is complete.\" This dual perspective\nhelps him explore scientific questions that have no obvious\nanswers yet.\nFaith also helps you transcend either/or thinking.

For thousands of years, people saw these\nas complementary ways of understanding the world. The split\nhappened mainly in the last few hundred years, and it's based on\nmisunders tandings about both science and religion.\nMany of the founders of modern science were deeply religious\npeople. Isaac Newton, who discovered the laws of physics, spent\nmore time studying the Bible than science. Gregor Mendel, who\nfigured out the basic rules of genetics, was a monk. Georges\nLemaître , who first proposed the Big Bang theory, was a Catholic\npriest. These brilliant minds saw no conflict between their\nscientific work and their spiritual beliefs.\nThe false choice between science and faith comes partly from\nmisunderstanding what science can and cannot tell us.

When\nyour mind wanders, you gently bring it back to your chosen focus.\nThis seemingly simple practice strengthens several cognitive\nfunctions:  sustained attention, cognitive control, and mental\ndiscipline.\nResearch at the University of California found that just eight\nweeks of focused meditation practice increased activity in the\nThe Unified Mind",

Like two hands\nworking together, they help you grasp reality more fully than\neither could alone.\nWe started by looking at the limits of pure logic. We saw how\nrational thinking alone hits walls when facing life's biggest\nquestions. It can tell us how things work but struggles to tell us\nwhy they matter. It can solve equations but can't fill the hunger\nfor meaning that lives in every human heart.\nThen we explored how faith changes your brain in real,\nmeasurable ways.

Einstein spoke of the \"cosmic religious\nfeeling\" that drove his scientific work. These brilliant minds used\nboth w ays of knowing together, not as competitors but as\ncomplementary tools.\nThe split between faith and reason is new in human history.\nFor thousands of years, people saw no conflict between studying\nthe natural world and connecting to something beyond it. The\nfalse choice between being smart or being spiritual hurts us all. It\nforces us to use only half our mental resources.\nIntegration doesn't mean making faith less faithful or reason\nless reasonable. It means letting each do what it does best. Science\nexcels at answering \"how\" questions - how stars shine, how\nbodies work, how brains process information.

This book has invited you to\nconsider a deeper integration between the faculties of faith and\nreason —not as opposing forces, but as complementary ways of\nknowing that, when harmonized,  awaken a fuller intelligence.\nWe’ve explored the landscape of inner life, examined the\nfractures in our collective thinking, and laid out a path toward\ncoherence: mentally, emotionally, and culturally.\nBut our work is not finished.\nThis book is the second in a trilogy that began with Signals in\nthe Noise , where we examined the distortions of modern life and\nhow unconscious programming, misinformation, and ideological\nrigidity obscure our ability to think clearly.

The answer, I believe, is\nnothing short of transformat ion. A unified mind does not flinch\nin the face of complexity. It becomes more curious, more capable\nof bearing ambiguity without despair. It becomes a mind worthy\nof a world in crisis.\nBut there's one more piece to this puzzle.\nThe final book in this trilogy, The Embodied Mind: Our Bodies\nKnow Before Our Brains Can Explain , will explore how\nconsciousness is not simply housed in the brain —it is lived\nthrough the body.",

This is because, as extensions in space, we and\nthe universe are essentially one and the same. Although this\nexplanation may not precisely depict how consciousness\nfunctions, it does point to a proc ess that's similarly intricate.\nFor example,  neuroscientists  tell us that our brains  organize\nour sensory  input  so that even  the experience  of time  is modified\nto make  our subjective  experience  seem  coordinated,  whole,  and\ncomplete.",

This philosophy can manifest as materialistic, where\nreality is b ased on physical substance, or idealistic, where the\nmental essence takes precedence.\nOn the other hand, non -dualism suggests that reality\nsurpasses simplistic binary concepts like 'one' and 'many.' It\nadvocates for an interconnectedness where delineations\nbetween subject and object, self and other, or even appearance\nand reality dissolve.\nOne interpretation suggests that monism is akin to a\nscientific revelation, asserting that all existence shares a\nunifying essence.

Fortunately,  that practice  is now  obsolete.\nSince  the development  of modern  medical  techniques,  we can\nbring  people  back  from  death  as we understood  it–clinical\ndeath —as previously  defined.

Consciousness  is defined  as awareness  and identity  – a\nsense  of subjective  awareness  that  includes  one’s  surroundings\ntogether  with  a sense  of self and personal  memories.\nThe five levels  were  defined  as follows:\n•Level  0: Nothing  survives.  All aspects  of being\nhuman  are dissolved  at the point  of bodily  death.  This  is\ncompatible  with  the materialistic  worldview  where  you\nare basically  your  brain  – so when  the brain  dies,  it\ncould  mean  that  all aspects  of you do, too.\n•Level  1: Pure  awareness  survives.  Personal  identity\nand memories  vanish.  What  survives  can be seen  as a\nformless,  transcendent  state,  with  no perception  of the\nenvironment  being  different  than  itself.\n•Level  2: Awareness  and limited  sense  of identity\nsurvive.",

Other\ntimes,  the medium  “tunes  in” and shares  any messages  they\nreceive.\nMost  of the time,  mediumship  implies  that  the medium\nreaches  out to the deceased  person.  But mediumship  can also\noccur  spontaneously  through  so-called  drop -in\ncommunication.  Verifying  the information  received  makes  it\nharder  for skeptics  to dismiss  mediumship  as invented\nmessages.\nCriticism  against  mental  mediumship  is that  the\ninformation  can be biased  by so-called  cold  reading.

In a triple -blind  setting,  the\nmedium  is unaware  of both  the deceased  person  and the sitters.\nThe channelings  are recorded  and transcribed.

Where does\nit begin? Is it in the brain —or does it start earlier,\ndeeper, in the body itself?\nThat question led me here, to The Embodied\nMind .\nThis book is the result of my ongoing attempt to\nunderstand consciousness —not as a philosophical\nabstraction, but as a practical, lived reality.

In Signals, I speculated\nthat spacetime —once the firm foundation of\nphysics —might be an emergent illusion, not a\nfundamental reality. At the time, that claim was still\ncontroversial. But t oday, physicists like Nima\nArkani -Hamed have declared outright that\n“spacetime is doomed.”1 His work shows that deeper\ngeometric structures, like the amplituhedron, may\nunderlie what we perceive as space and time.\nLikewise, Carlo Rovelli, a pioneer of loop quantum\ngravity, reminds us that “space is a function of\nquantum processes, not a containe r where things\nhappen.",
